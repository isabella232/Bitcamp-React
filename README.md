# Bitcamp React.js

React is a fun and interactive front end web framework that is quickly taking over the world! We want to create a 4-week bootcamp about React for students who have some knowledge of JavaScript and are ready to pick up a new technology. We will be focusing on the functional components and React Hooks as opposed to React class components.

**Why Hooks instead of the traditional classes?**

You only have one state object per component class in React which means there will be times where fields are placed together in the state object that has nothing to do with each other. This makes the code confusing. You need to bind 'this' for every event handler function. This is not intuitive and can be difficult for React newbies to understand.

Hooks were created to address the above concerns and several others. Hooks make React much cleaner, easier to read, and easier to write. The developers of React see Hooks as its future. They do not currently have plans to remove class support but within the Hooks FAQ they state "In the longer term, we expect Hooks to be the primary way people write React components." Hence, I believe Hooks are the proper way to teach React in 2020.

**What will the student work on?**

The students will create a Todo list and a Carousel. 

Many other React tutorials begin with a Todo list as it is a simple assignment that is able to show off many of features React offers. The first three weeks will prepare the students in finishing a simple Todo list.

The carousel does a phenomenal job at showcasing the power and features of React Hooks. Many websites include a carousel on their homepage which makes this project quite practical. Ryan Florence, a React Developer, created a carousel for React Conf 2018 (where hooks were first introduced to the public) and it's his code we'll be working off of.

### **Week 1**

Establish an understanding of a functional component and its parts.

**Objective: These are all required in understanding how to use React and the way React integrates JavaScript and HTML into JSX**

- Learn Functional Components
- Understand ReactDOM and render
- Learn JSX

**Homework**

- Students will be given a few broken components to debug
- Asked to create a component composed of a header, main, and footer component

### **Week 2**

Introduce students to props and the useState Hook.

**Objective: These two aspects of React are best learned together and are the most vital in creating a React app.** 

- Learn what props are and how they are used to pass information between components
- Briefly talk about Hooks before going into useState and why state makes React so dynamic

**Homework**

- Have a component update its parent's state
- Have a component update its siblings props

### **Week 3**

Provide a more in-depth explanation of Hooks. Introduce and elaborate on useEffect and useRef.

**Objective: Both useEffect and useRef are Hooks that are required in the Todo list and carousel and are commonly used Hooks. Here it is important to show useEffect's verbose class equivalent to understand why React Developers are moving toward Hooks. Students should also understand that you can create your own Hooks and use others the community has created.**

- Explain useEffect and its class equivalent along with useRef
- Show how to create your own Hooks
- Start the Todo list but leave parts of it for the students to complete

Homework

- Complete the Todo list

### **Week 4**

Create the carousel project.

**Objective: We want to provide the students with knowledge they may need to apply for an employer or client in the future and many websites include a carousel on their homepage. The carousel uses all the Hooks we have gone over in the previous weeks and also requires a user created Hook making it a practical capstone.**

- Build a carousel but leave out certain parts of it for the students to complete

Homework

- Complete the carousel
